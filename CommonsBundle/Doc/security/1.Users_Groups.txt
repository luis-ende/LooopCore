* LLP Base uses the FOSUserBundle to manage user and group management
-> FOSUserBundle must be added to composer.json and app/AppKernel.php

FOSUserBundle provides:
-> User and Goup DB definitions, that are extended by looopcorecommons
-> Templates and functionality to register / change password etc.

We have the entities "user" and "group" in the base bundle, which extend the classes
from the FOSUserBundle.
The connection user-group is N:M.

Also, there are fixed ROLES defined in the config files of each bundle.

The connection is as follows:
User <-> Group <-> Role [ <-> Rights]


What is there:
-> Templates to register / login / change pw / send forgotten password etc.


What has to be done:
--------------------

-> Let the FOSUserBundle templates use the base layout
-> integrate more GUI functions 
  -> it's possible to use the SonataAdminBundle to automatically 
     create controllers to edit the DB (Users/Groups/Roles)

Note (!!!): 3 classes inside the FOSUserBundle have to be replaced in /vendor. (that will be fixed in the future)
